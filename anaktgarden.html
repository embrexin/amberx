            Anakt Garden is a music-specialized kindergarten that helps participants 
            improve their musical literacy while practicing to be part of the Alien Stage 
            competitions. Many participants of Alien Stage, 
            including the main cast, were students at Anakt Garden.

            The MIZISUA official lore video depicts the two as children while they were presumably being transported to Anakt Garden.
            In the video of this scene, Mizi has tons of equipment in her case, and is sent off by her owners with love. 
            On the other hand, Sua's owners left nothing in her case, highlighting the differences in how they've been raised. <br><br>
            Mizi and Sua both attended Anakt Garden together. Mizi is shown to secretly listen to Sua singing a melody 
            during playtime, as she found her voice beautiful. <br><br>

            Mizi wins Round 1 with 87 points to Sua's 86.
            The lyrics at the start of the song, sung by both Mizi and Sua, are about finding hope that is bloomed in the abyss,
             possibly implying that they were each other's hope, and the next lyric says that they should be by each other's side always. 
             The last few lyrics, only sung by Mizi after Sua dies, are the complete opposite, saying that her hope was 
             "withered in the abyss", as Sua is now dead.<br><br>
             It is confirmed Mizi and Sua were supposed to sing the song in parts, but they sang every part together in an attempt to 
             have equal points and end with a tie, making the 1 point difference between them even more devestating.

            Ivan and Till have known each other since they were young as they both resided in Anakt Garden. 
            Like the many other humans that were captured, Till has suffered abuse from his alien jailer since he was a child.
            It is implied that his rebellious nature made him a target for especially harsh punishment, as evidenced by 
            the numerous bruises across his face in his introductory video.

            During his time at Anakt Garden, Till developed a crush on Mizi. Although he usually never approached her 
            directly, he is depicted observing her from afar and even follows her after she loses her flower crown in an alien's den. 
            Ivan is depicted observing Till and Mizi at intervals when they are children. Sometime later, they became friends, 
            though the details of how or when remain undisclosed. Afterwards, Ivan discovered a way to escape and convinced Till to join him. 
            However, as they ran, Till abruptly stopped and turned back, likely because he could not abandon Mizi.

                Ivan and Till compete against each other in Round 6. The song they sing, "Cure", has lyrics that 
                reflect the two's relationship. Specifically, Ivan sings, "Even if your cold words/ Carve scars beneath my eyes/ May they linger on your tongue/You can break me apart.
                Ivan's romantic obsession with Till was heavily implied in Round 3 (the round Ivan was introduced in). However,
                Round 6 only served to emphasize the depths of his feelings. As the lyrics show, Ivan is happy as long as Till notices him. He wants Till to see that he can give him all 
                that Till yearns for in Mizi and more.<br><br>
                In contrast to Ivan, Till appears to be singing about Mizi.  At the end of Round 5, the audience is left unclear about
                whether Mizi has survived, since Hyuna and her rebel team are only briefly shown through the smoke. At the beginning of Round 6, Till looks defeated and exhausted, a far cry from his
                rebellious attitude in Round 2 (his introduction), which highlights how he may believe Mizi to be dead. In the song, he sings, "I don't want to let you go". His reluctance to move forward causes
                him to be stuck in hopeless eternity.<br><br>
                Although Ivan believes himself to be selfish when it comes too Till, the reality is anything but. In Round 6, Ivan is heavily implied to sacrifice himself on purpose so that Till could win.

            Both Hyuna and Luka attended Anakt Garden alongside each other and were shown to be relatively close. 
            They often hung out together along with Hyuna's brother when they were kids, revealed as early as mid-2023 in official art. 
            Luka presumably had a crush on Hyuna at the time but it is unlikely that this crush was reciprocated.

                Hyuna is first officially introduced through the All-In music video. Both the song and the overall mood of the music video
                vary greatly from the others that make up the Alien Stage series. While the other videos are darker in aesthetic and mood, Hyuna's reflects her
                outgoing and free-spirited personality. Although it's clear she is still haunted by her brother's death, Hyuna is cheerful and
                appears to be satisfied with her life as a rebel (at least compared to her time at Anakt Garden).

            On the official website for Alien Stage, there is an image of a glitched out profile for a girl named "Zeus" 
            whose hair colour and eye shape resemble that of Hyuna. Based on this implication, Hyuna is "Zeus", the leader of a rebel faction.
